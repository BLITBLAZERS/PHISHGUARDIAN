# PHISHGUARDIAN : Revolutionizing Phishing Domain Detection
PhishGuardian, a vanguard in digital security, deploys advanced AI/ML techniques, from backend code/content analysis to web page image scrutiny, to swiftly identify phishing domains among newly registered websites. It empowers users with probability scores and maintains user-friendliness, redefining digital vigilance in an ever-changing landscape. This masterpiece of cybersecurity stands ready to safeguard the digital realm, one domain at a time.

# Mission and Vision
At its core, the mission of phishing website detection is to shield users from deceitful online stratagems designed to pilfer personal and financial data. This critical endeavor stands as a bulwark against financial deception, preserving trust in digital services, ensuring legal compliance, safeguarding brand reputation, and nurturing cybersecurity awareness.

This endeavor entails the meticulous curation of an extensive dataset, seamlessly amalgamating legitimate and phishing URLs. Diverse attributes are carefully gleaned, encompassing URL traits, domain intricacies, HTML composition, and intricate web image analysis. The multifaceted detection arsenal encompasses a harmonious blend of machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, and potent boosters. Together, they form a formidable defense against the menace of phishing attacks.

In a steadfast commitment to data security, this dataset is thoughtfully decentralized, reinforcing our unwavering dedication to upholding the digital realm's integrity.

In a bid to bolster data security, this dataset has been thoughtfully decentralized, fortifying our commitment to preserving the digital realm's integrity.

# Data collection
The collection of URL links is derived from open datasets generously provided by the University of New Brunswick (https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/url-2016.html). A comprehensive dataset has been meticulously crafted, merging 5000 randomly selected legitimate and phishing websites into a single repository.

# Modeling and training 
Our methodology comprises the application of five machine learning models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Additionally, two deep learning models—Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)—and two model boosters—AdaBoost and XGBoost—have been harnessed to further enhance detection capabilities. The image analysis component of our methodology is a pivotal part of our phishing domain detection system. It involves extracting meaningful information from images on web pages. This process includes retrieving images, extracting features like color and texture patterns, and using deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to recognize complex visual patterns.

# Future Scope
In our unwavering pursuit of excellence, we envision a future for PhishGuardian that transcends the boundaries of innovation. Our relentless commitment to enhancing accuracy and efficacy propels us toward a horizon teeming with possibilities:

Elevating Probability Scores: We shall ascend to new heights of precision by refining and expanding our probability scoring mechanisms. Precision is our lodestar, and it shall guide us as we delve deeper into the nuances of phishing domain detection.

Harnessing the Power of Natural Language Processing (NLP): The linguistic tapestry of the web holds the keys to a deeper understanding. By deploying NLP to parse the intricate language hidden in the backend of websites, we unveil a treasure trove of insights that will fortify our defenses against emerging threats.

The Triumph of Blockchain: Our future envisions the fortification of data integrity through the implementation of blockchain technology. By securing our datasets with the immutable ledger, we ensure not only the sanctity of our data but also the trust of those who rely on it.

User Experience Elevated to the Pinnacle: Our commitment to user-friendliness remains steadfast. An engaging and intuitive user interface (UI) will serve as the portal through which users interact with our vigilant guardian. It shall be an interface that not only empowers but also inspires trust and confidence.

In this ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, PhishGuardian stands as a beacon of innovation, illuminating the path toward a future where digital threats are met with unwavering resilience. Our journey continues, as we forge ahead, pioneering the art of protection and redefining the limits of what is possible.
